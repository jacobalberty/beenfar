## Contributing
Although I have a LICENSE up and you are welcome to use this under that license to any extent allowed under that license, I have not decided on the actual final license and may change to a more restrictive or less restrictive license at any time.

Due to the license being in flux at this time no code contributions will be accepted to this repository. Once the final license has been decided I will update this document and start allowing pull requests. In the meantime if you want to contribute discussions and issues are welcome even discussions about the contributing policy are allowed. 

If you have a fork and the license on this repository changes you may continue to use code under the old license up until that change with that license, but please consider any new code to be part of a new project under the new license.
